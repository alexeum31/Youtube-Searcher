# Youtube Searcher

As a part of our CUbits.ai internship, for our first project, Alex and Brian created a "Youtube Searcher" application. This application was made through react in order for us to get oriented to the react syntax and API calls. We fetched data from the Youtube API in order to fetch a certain amount of videos of the specific topic that is inputed into the application.
